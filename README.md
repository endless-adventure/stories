Stories
=======
These are submitted stories for Endless Adventure

The Premise
===========
The idea here is to fill this spot up with stories.

Some Constraints
================
The submitted stories should have some metadata and be released under a Creative Commons license
The metadata ought to include things like:

Authors name (or pen name)

Genre

The stories ought to be written in a way to allow for a story to move from one to another with minimal impact to the overall user experience.

Future Ideas
============
Write some way for stories written under Creative Commons license to be found, imported and broken up into content for the overall feel of a users experience while still maintaining the intended integrity of the CC license.

The enormity of stories should not need to be housed in a database or anything...I think that wherever they originate out of and are hosted at currently, could be a good way to pre load content based on a keyword search and match to maintain a flow with the preceeding story.
